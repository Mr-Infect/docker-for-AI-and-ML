## 🚀 **Why Use Docker for AI Development?**
Docker is an essential tool for AI/ML engineers, providing:
- **Reproducibility**: Ensure that models work across different environments.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Leverage NVIDIA GPUs for deep learning workloads.
- **Scalability**: Deploy AI models across multiple instances with Kubernetes.
- **Dependency Management**: Run AI models without dependency conflicts.

## 🏗️ **Essential Docker Containers for AI**

| Container | Description | GPU Support |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| `tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu` | TensorFlow with GPU acceleration | ✅ |
| `pytorch/pytorch:latest` | PyTorch with Python and CUDA support | ✅ |
| `nvidia/cuda:12.1-devel` | Base CUDA image for deep learning frameworks | ✅ |
| `jupyter/tensorflow-notebook` | Jupyter Notebook with TensorFlow pre-installed | ❌ |
| `jupyter/pytorch-notebook` | Jupyter Notebook with PyTorch pre-installed | ❌ |
| `deepspeed/deepspeed:latest` | Optimized deep learning model training | ✅ |

> **Note:** GPU support requires NVIDIA Docker (`nvidia-docker2`) and compatible drivers.

## 🔧 **Useful Docker Commands**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `docker ps` | List running containers |
| `docker images` | Show available images |
| `docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu` | Pull TensorFlow GPU image |
| `docker run --gpus all -it pytorch/pytorch:latest bash` | Run a PyTorch container with GPU |
| `docker volume create ml-data` | Create a volume for ML datasets |
| `docker run -v ml-data:/data my-ml-container` | Attach volume to container |
| `docker stats` | Monitor container performance |
